## Project Goal

Magnific Popup: https://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/ is an out of the box image gallery solution that allows user to navigate using tab on a keyboard, for screenreader accessibility. 

I'd like to employ a version of this image gallery with some modifications that include masonry and alt text for images. This should result in an example of a fully screenreader accessible image gallery with really cool visuals.

## Expected Process
* JS
* JQuery
* CSS

I am going to look for snippets of masonry options that are already available on other out of the box solutitons to hopefully get the best of both worlds. The alt text for images I expect to be simple addition of tags. 

## Final Product Requirements

* Display multiple photos and videos at once
* Display thumbnails in either a grid or using masonry
* Selecting a thumbnail expands to a modal
* Scrolling between images while in the modal can be done using keyboard or clicking arrows
* Images all have captions and alt text in the modal
* The caption on an image in the modal can have links or buttons
